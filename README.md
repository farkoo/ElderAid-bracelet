# ElderAid smart health bracelet


The rapid increase in the average age of the world's people and the increase in life expectancy have drawn the attention of policy makers to the need to use automatic monitoring systems for the elderly in society.


Elderly system is a comprehensive system for finding, transferring and analyzing the vital data of the elderly, which monitors the elderly around the clock. This system can be installed in nursing homes or in the private homes of the elderly. The data is delivered as input to artificial intelligence models and the system sends the necessary settings to the wristband, which is the hardware part of the data collection from the elderly. Internet of Things concepts have been used in the design of this system to produce wristbands and transfer data. Also, the concepts of artificial intelligence and Big Data have been used in the analysis section.
